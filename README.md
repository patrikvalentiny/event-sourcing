# Event Sourcing Synopsis Template

## 1. Introduction / Motivation
Event sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern that addresses several critical challenges in modern software systems. In this project, I focus on how event sourcing can enhance reliability, scalability, evolvability, and auditability in application design. These aspects are essential for building robust systems that can handle growth, adapt to change, and provide transparent histories of all operations. By exploring these topics, I aim to demonstrate the practical and theoretical benefits of event sourcing for both developers and organizations.

## 2. Problem Statement
The main problem addressed in this synopsis is how to design and implement systems that are reliable, scalable, evolvable, and auditable. Traditional data management approaches often struggle to meet these requirements simultaneously. This project investigates how event sourcing can be leveraged to overcome these challenges, providing a foundation for systems that are resilient to failure, can grow efficiently, adapt to new requirements, and maintain a complete audit trail of all changes.

## 3. Methodology
In this project, I will use a .NET backend to implement event sourcing. I will investigate and compare different strategies for reconstructing the latest state of an object from its event history, such as replaying all events, using snapshots, and hybrid approaches.

Evaluation will focus on:
- The efficiency and scalability of each state reconstruction method.
- The impact on reliability and auditability.
- The ease of evolving the data model over time.

The hypothesis is that event sourcing, combined with appropriate state reconstruction strategies, can provide a robust foundation for building reliable, scalable, evolvable, and auditable systems. The results will confirm or reject this hypothesis based on the measured outcomes and qualitative analysis.
